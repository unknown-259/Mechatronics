Code written for Uno32 and Raspberry Pi Pico. Project ".X" files are edited in MPLabX IDE.
This project is a pinball machine. The repo only contains the code part of the project. The project is running in a 
simple event/service system, and the main logic is handled by a giant state machine, which is composed of 9 states.
